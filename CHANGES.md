# Online Steganography Project - Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Hidden Text Not Showing After Clicking Reveal
**Problem:** The "Reveal Hidden Message" button wasn't showing the decoded text.
**Solution:**
- Fixed the decode button functionality in `chat.html`
- Improved error handling in the JavaScript decode function
- Fixed the `decodeMsg()` function to properly handle button states
- Added better debugging output in backend

### 2. ✅ Messages Not Stored in Database
**Problem:** User wanted messages NOT stored in database for security.
**Solution:**
- Confirmed that Message model only stores image paths, NOT message text
- Message text is ONLY embedded in the image using LSB steganography
- No plaintext storage anywhere in the system

### 3. ✅ Image Download Feature
**Problem:** User wanted ability to download encoded images.
**Solution:**
- Added "Download Image" button for each message
- Implemented `downloadImage()` JavaScript function
- Users can now download any encoded image and decode it offline

### 4. ✅ Upload Any Image to Decode Hidden Text
**Problem:** User wanted to upload any steganography image and decode it.
**Solution:**
- Added "Decode Any Image" section in chat page
- Implemented client-side LSB decoding using JavaScript Canvas API
- Users can upload any encoded image and reveal hidden messages instantly

## Technical Changes

### Backend Changes

**MessageController.java:**
- Enhanced `decodeMessage()` endpoint with better error handling
- Added HTML escaping to prevent XSS attacks
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting

**StegoUtil.java:**
- Fixed `decodeText()` method to properly read LSB data
- Added proper byte reading logic with outer loop breaking
- Added validation for data length
- Added debug output for troubleshooting

**Message.java:**
- Confirmed model only has: id, sender, receiver, imagePath, sentAt
- NO text/message field - messages are only in images

### Frontend Changes

**chat.html:**
- Added "Download Image" button to each message
- Added "Decode Any Image" section with file upload
- Implemented client-side LSB decoder using Canvas API
- Improved button states and loading indicators
- Better error messages and user feedback
- Improved UI with icons and better styling

## Security Features

1. **No Plaintext Storage:** Message text is ONLY in the encoded image
2. **HTML Escaping:** All decoded messages are escaped to prevent XSS
3. **Secure Downloads:** Images can be downloaded and decoded on any device
4. **Offline Decoding:** Works even outside the application

## How It Works

1. **Sending:**
   - User uploads an image and types a message
   - Backend uses `StegoUtil.encodeText()` to hide message in image using LSB
   - Only the encoded image is saved to database and storage

2. **Decoding:**
   - Server-side: Click "Reveal" button → calls backend API → decodes image
   - Client-side: Upload image → JavaScript decodes using Canvas API
   - Both methods reveal the same hidden message

3. **Downloading:**
   - Click download button → saves image to local device
   - Can be decoded using the app or any steganography tool

## Files Modified

1. `src/main/resources/templates/chat.html` - Complete UI overhaul
2. `src/main/java/com/example/onlinestego/controller/MessageController.java` - Better decoding
3. `src/main/java/com/example/onlinestego/util/StegoUtil.java` - Fixed decoding logic
4. `README.txt` - Updated documentation

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Send a message with hidden text
2. Click "Reveal Hidden Message" - should show the text
3. Click "Download Image" - should save the image
4. Upload the downloaded image in "Decode Any Image" - should show the text
5. Check database - should only contain image paths, not message text
